## Scenarios

    Identify top-performing (West) and low-performing regions (South) to make marketing and sales allocation decisions.
### 2.Managerial Performance Review:
    Chris and Erin show positive profits, while Sam reflects a loss (-17.86%). Training or restructuring may be needed.
### 3.Product Return Reduction Strategy:
    Office Supplies category has the highest return count (871), followed by Technology (438). Further analysis may help reduce return rates and improve customer satisfaction.

    The average discount is 4.77%, helping assess if discounts are boosting sales or unnecessarily reducing margins.
### 5.Trend Analysis Over Time:
    Year-wise trend shows a rise in profit and sales in recent periods. Strategic actions taken earlier might be working well.
### 6.Sales vs Return Analysis:
    Scatter plot helps to understand how returns impact profit compared to non-returned orders, identifying risk products or customers.
